But when he couldn't take any more of his father's tyrannical behavior, he moves out on his own, determined to make his own way in the world. But going from super-rich to super-poor is tough on any man (let alone one still in high school), and it's going to take more hard work than Haruhiko imagined just to make ends meet. He's doing his best and trying to keep up his spirits, but living on bean sprouts and bread crusts is enough to get any man down. Fortunately, he's got his sexy classmates and his own personal maid to help him out.",
