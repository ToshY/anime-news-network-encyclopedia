Hugo wants to be the one to arrest him after chasing him for so long. However, the chase hits a turning point when Dr. Martin confesses that he became a thief just so he could catch Hugo's attention... because he says he loves Hugo. Hugo still wants to arrest Martin, but with Martin's confession, he doesn't know what to do about the recent turn of events... or what to do about his own feelings. Meanwhile, Martin waits patiently for Hugo to come around...",
