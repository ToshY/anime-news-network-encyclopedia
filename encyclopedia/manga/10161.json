Unfortunately, his classmate Kirishima can see right through him. Then, when Kaoru Sakamoto moves back to his home town, he tries to understand why his old friend Snow doesn't want to be called by his name anymore- and how it's his fault. Next, Miyaji goes to interview the adopted son of a recently deceased artist and finds that Masanari's story is more dark and intriguing than he could have imagined. Finally, Fujinari is a widower of six months. He feels guilty for never loving his wife, and an odd visitor seems to know all about it.",
