Amuri Kakyoin is a 13 year old girl born with a special 'Allergy', called 'Repultion'. This ability keeps her from actually touching most of her environment, but also protects her from harm. During a trip to space station Pink Coral, unknown enemies from the junk planet Galapagos attack and destroy the entire space station. Amuri survives being launched into space because of her 'Allergy', but is picked up by the attackers. When the machines of Galapagos attempt to destroy her, a girl named Suzu Ling Yunque shows up with a kimono-like space suit designed from Amuri's DNA. The suit lets her use her 'Repulsion' ability on a large scale. Amuri has lived her whole life unable to touch other people, however, this cheerful and strange girl was not Repulsed upon contact. <em class=de-emphasized>(from OAV)</em>",
