However, Lune never wanted to be the crown princess, and her marquis adoptive father practically sold her to the crown prince. But as she and her family are executed, the Great Fox Spirit Reineke hears Lune's prayers and sends her back in time to avert this terrible fate. What's more, she now has fox ears that can hear the voices of spirits. Lune is determined to save her people, but she must first win over House Renard, the family that adopted her but always treated her coldly—especially her brother Liam. She was sure that Liam hated her, but now he's always doting on her. With Liam and the spirits by her side, Lune will find a happy ending for everyone. <em class=de-emphasized>(from manga)</em>",
