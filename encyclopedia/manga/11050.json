They wanted to go to Kakegawa High School, one whose football club is relatively new but founded by the legendary high school footballer Kubo Yoshiharu, whose talents are expected to bring Japan to the world stage in the future. Though they nearly couldn't play together anymore, they were united once again with the help of a pretty girl named Kazumi Endo, who quickly became the source of motivation for Toshi and Kazuhiro as the club's manager. Together with Kubo, they arise as new challengers who would create their own legends.",
