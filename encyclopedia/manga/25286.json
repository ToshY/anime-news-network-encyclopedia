That's why it's a surprise when he eventually recognizes Leo – and realizes that not only was Leo hoping not to run into anyone from high school, he's actively upset that Junpei is there. Junpei quickly learns that Leo's high school experience wasn't rosy and turned him away from interacting with others, and he offers to be the other young man's friend. When Leo tentatively takes him up on it, both men find that friendship may be turning into something more – if they have the courage to acknowledge it.",
