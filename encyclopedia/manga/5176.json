Half of the council disagrees making the Queen reformulate her proposition. She instead asks that the girls become witch apprentices once again and that in order to become full-fledged witches they should convince the council members who voted against the appeal that they are worthy. Unanimously accepted; Doremi, Hazuki, Aiko, and Onpu will have to learn how to make sweets to persuade the six senior witches. To help them familiarize with the process of making sweets, the Witch Queen introduces them to a witch apprentice named Momoko Asuka. She lived in New York for many years assisting in a bakery owned by a witch. <em class=de-emphasized>(from TV)</em>",
