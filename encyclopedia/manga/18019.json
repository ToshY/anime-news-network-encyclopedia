He is excited because the manager of the apartments is his childhood friend Yua who Haruya harbors feelings for. He never dreamed that he would end up making love to her on his first night there. However, the next morning he is shocked to learn that Yua performs sex acts for all the male tenants as part of an added service to justify a higher rent to pay for the apartment's utilities and renovations. Without it the tenants would leave because the communal bath is haunted. Not only that, but she's a sex addict. Despite having his image of the seemingly sweet and innocent Yua shattered and forever altered, Haruya is still determined to win not only her body but also her love. Although, when Yua's younger sister, Yumi, catches them in the act, and the daughter of one of the tenants, Momoko, moves in things begin to get complicated.",
