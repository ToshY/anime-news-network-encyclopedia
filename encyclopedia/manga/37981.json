Now transferred to a remote town in rural Kyushu, he spends his days practicing general medicine--struggling to understand the thick local dialect of his elderly patients and to suppress the crushing guilt that haunts him. Each night, he drowns his sorrows in alcohol, but one particularly miserable evening, he's approached by a mysterious man who calls himself Tenju: a yakuza who offers him a night of escape. Swept into a haze of unfamiliar pleasure, Higuchi begins to feel something stir beneath the numbness.",
