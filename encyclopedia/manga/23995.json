Because every girl he interacts with shows him nothing but scorn, and he's not scored a single date from it. Luckily, he's more concerned with securing a spot for him and his game-development buddies at his uncle's business. But when his uncle throws him a condition that involves playing the part of his daughter's boyfriend, Akiteru has no choice but to take it. His best friend's sister Iroha, bullies him relentlessly, but doesn't seem too pleased by the news. <em class=de-emphasized>(from manga)</em>",
