She's lonely because her ability causes other people to pull away from her and whisper behind her back. While trying to escape the pain of her negative reputation, she meets a specter from her past, named Akajita, and a boy from her school (alternately described in the English translation as her school chairman and someone in her same class), named Kaname Yatou. Although Yatou can also see supernatural beings, he hates them (due to events from his past). Hatsuse loves them because she feels less lonely when the spirits are around her, so she repeatedly puts herself in dangerous situations while trying to help out the beings she sees. Yatou, then, repeatedly tries to keep her away from supernatural beings in order to protect her even as he becomes entangled in a supernatural conflict from his parents' past. Meanwhile, a love triangle grows between Yatou, Hatsuse, and Akajita.",
