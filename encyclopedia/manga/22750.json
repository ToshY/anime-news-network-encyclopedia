Now reincarnated into a fantasy world, Sansui is one of the Immortals, capable of immense power as long as he's willing to put centuries of work into achieving it. One day, after five hundred years of swinging his sword, his monotonous existence is upended entirely by the appearance of a little baby. His master sends him out into the world to raise the child, and it's there that he meets a haughty young noblewoman and her tomboyish bodyguard. His fighting style may be bland and unpretentious, but the fast-paced mortal world is about to find out just how good even the most hopeless swordsman can get with half a millennium of practice behind him. <em class=de-emphasized>(from manga)</em>",
