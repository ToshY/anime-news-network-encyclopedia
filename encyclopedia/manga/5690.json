The weak Earth Federation is caught off-guard by the attacks due to their complacency. As a result, the Crossbones Vanguard conquer the Frontier IV colony almost immediately, renaming it \"Cosmo Babylonia\". Caught in the crossfire is college student Seabook Arno, who sees many of his friends killed during the skirmish and discovers that his girlfriend Cecily Fairchild is actually Berah Ronah—heir to the Ronah family clan and the Crossbone Vanguard. He then finds out that his mother is alive and has been working on a new mobile suit codenamed \"Gundam Formula-91\". Seabook reluctantly pilots the Gundam at first, but slowly discovers the Newtype abilities within him and uses them and the Gundam to turn the tide of the war. <em class=de-emphasized>(from movie)</em>",
