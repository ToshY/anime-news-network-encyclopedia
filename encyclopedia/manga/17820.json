Learning what happened, the mysterious science teacher Yamada offered Ajio a \"help\" by literally \"pulling out\" an exact copy of Chiaki out of her body, right before his eyes. The clone, tentatively named \"Koaki,\" is physically and mentally identical to Chiaki except lacking memory of having a boyfriend. Turned out Yamada is a life form far, far more advanced than humans; he ordered a \"competition\" to be taken that while Chiaki could continue going out with her boyfriend, Ajio must now start going out and live together with Koaki. The passion levels of two girls will be measured months later and the two will be merged back; \"winner\"'s memory will overwrite \"loser\"'s.",
