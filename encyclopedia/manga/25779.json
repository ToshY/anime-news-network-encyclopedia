He's on the tube one day when the mayor of London is killed, stabbed inside a train car in a crime no one can make sense of. Al isn't even aware that he was in such close proximity to the murder until a police detective named Ellis comes to his door…and all of a sudden the bloody knife Al found planted in his pocket takes on a horrible new meaning. Ellis has been burned by a past case gone wrong, and he knows that if the good people of London learn that a brown man found a knife that may well be the murder weapon, Al is likely to be railroaded through the system. So instead he offers Al a deal: the two of them will work together to figure out who might want to frame Al for a murder he doesn't believe he committed.",
