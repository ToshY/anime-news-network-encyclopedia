What she discovered was that many of the symptoms described not only her baby, but also herself. For her entire life, she struggled socially, couldn't keep up with expectations in school or at work, and never seemed to fit in, and while the diagnosis was frightening at first, it also provided a lot of answers. In order to learn more about herself and people like her, she collected the stories of other people with similar diagnoses and turned them into this manga to share them with the world.",
