One day, she missed a step on a staircase and when she woke up, she was in the body of a 17-year-old high school student named Hana Yamada. At a loss, she ends up living the life of a high school girl at the boarding house Hana Yamada lived at, Ikuta House. She's surrounded by the responsible adult Haruki, and the high school boy Haruchika. She's having trouble not falling for all the guys around her, but she can't fall in love in someone else's body.",
