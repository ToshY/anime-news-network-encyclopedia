Mankind has rebuilt itself and, through the lessons learned from the previous era, managed to sustain a long lasting peace. However conflict has once again arisen, resulting from disagreements regarding the world's only space orbital elevator, the Capital Tower, and its role as the sole means by which nations on Earth obtain energy. During a routine training session while ascending the Capital Tower, Capital Guard pilot cadet Bellri Zenam, tasked with protection of the Tower, fights off an attacking space pirate, Aida Rayhunton, and helps capture her mobile suit, the G-Self. Strangely, Bellri finds out that he is one of the only three individuals to be able to pilot this mysterious mobile suit. Seemingly chosen by the G-Self, Bellri is thus drawn into a brewing conflict that will have consequences for the entire world. <em class=de-emphasized>(from TV)</em>",
