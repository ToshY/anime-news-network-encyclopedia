At a party held by the agency, he met a strange girl wearing sunglasses and a ski mask asking him for a date. Despite of her weird habit (she never took off her mask), their relationship went pretty well, and soon the couple fell in love and married secretly. On their first night together, she finally took off her mask and revealed her true identity: Kirari-chan, a beautiful pop idol (and Futa is her biggest fan), who has a secret wish: to get married with a man who doesn't love her beauty, money, or fame -- but her true self.",
