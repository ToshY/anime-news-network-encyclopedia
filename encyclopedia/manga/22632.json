These new beings began to hunger for knowledge, and to do research and catalog ideas, they formed an academy called Wizdom's, named for their esteemed and benevolent creator. Now, Wizdom's is host for many, young and old, teachers and students. And in these hallowed halls, full of powerful magics, love exists in turn. A Unicorn, ostracized from his society for his sexuality, finds surprising connection in a curmudgeonly old owl. A deer takes care of his snake roommate during winter. A bunny has a crush on the cat who tutors him. A group of prankster bats discover their connection goes beyond liking mischief and mayhem. All this and more in the whimsical school of Wizdom's.",
