The first path towards that goal is to strike out Shingo Ouki, the prodigy baseball player that hit 24 consecutive home runs out of the park at Koshien, with #24 being against Yu (though Yu did get one strike, his only 100%-strength pitch against Ouki). Unfortunately, Aoi's pitches are much like his brother's: So powerful that no catcher can seemingly handle them except for each Tendo brother. But when a boy named Ai asks to be Aoi's catcher, Aoi might have found the second wing he needs in order to fly high, like the blue bird that brings happiness.",
