However, after arriving this new school her health degenerated rapidly, plus the leader of school gang Kashii had an eye on her and tried to assault her when she took a rest in school infirmary. When Souko was resisting she lost conscience for a moment, and after she woke up Kashii vaporized but his clothes scattered on the floor, with her physical strength fully recovered. Panicked, Souko took a leave, but the next day she learned that Kashii returned to school as if nothing happened -- only this time, this \"Kashii\" was a completely different person, yet everyone else said just the opposite. While Souko began to question her own sanity, this new \"Kashii\" seemed trying to kill her.",
