In the beginning, the four could hardly play together and often quarreled, for each of them was very talented and had different opinions over the music to be performed. However, during a practice session, they broke a bust statue accidentally and found an ancient sheet music hidden inside the statue, probably handwritten by the composer himself. Fearing to be punished, they didn't tell anyone about the manuscript and began investigation themselves. With a shared secret and a common goal, their relationships quickly improved. They didn't know, however, that the welcome concert was held with a secret purpose.",
