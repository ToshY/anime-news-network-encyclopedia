For one, the main character Yoshida Miake \"Mike\" is a charismatic first year high school student that is in love with her best friend whom she had known all of her life. The only problem that occurs is that he has no interest in her whatsoever. But he likes another, as Mike will painfully discover. It's then when she slowly realizes that there is somebody else with who she \"connects,\" even though he is not really giving in to start a relationship with her. Both are thick-headed when they want to and, thruthfully, they deserve each other. But how she develop a relationship with a person that exchanges kisses for lunch.",
