She has no youth to misspend and no time to think about boys until her classmate, “King Normie” Kijima, approaches her with a shocking confession of love. She tries to lose Kijima, but he just can't take a hint and as her mind runs wild with impure thoughts, she realizes her father has totally influenced her.",
