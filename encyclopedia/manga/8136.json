Not only does he survive, but the piece of meteor that is stuck in his head seems to grant a miracle in that Shinya now has super human strength which he uses to more effectively help others. Soon an even larger meteor is reported to hit the very same city. While the rest of the city is evacuated, Shinya stays behind, believing that his new powers will allow him to stop the meteor. But his protective friend, Chiho, worries that such a task is too much for him.",
