It is set on Earth after humans have used up almost all the water on the planet, rendering it a precious commodity. Juju, a teenage gang leader, is robbing a convience store for water when Rael, a mysterious young girl bound in chains, appears to him. Of course, he doesn't really know who or what Rael is, which spurs him to set off on the journey that seems to be a fair chunk of the plot of this manga. He eventually manages to help Rael escape her house, branding him as an outlaw. As the authorities mount a search for Juju and Rael, they team up with the Captain (your standard-grade comic-relief character) and Yunfa (the girl who is jealous of all the attention Juju gives Rael). Eventually the Professor Guy is introduced, who seems to have a history with Rael, and later there are two others who seek Rael (Ursula and Peewee) to further their own mysterious ends.",
