One day, she’s offered a chance to change her status and situation—by competing to become the next royal consort. Therese hesitates, unsure that someone as poor as herself could ever be a consort, and decides to decline the opportunity. That is until she learns that just being a candidate could lead to a high-paying position as a lady-in-waiting. Determined to take the chance, she decides to go for it. But when she arrives at the castle, she realizes that this competition is way more cut-throat than she anticipated. Can Therese’s down-to-earth attitude keep her safe and above the fray. Or will this contest cost her everything.",
