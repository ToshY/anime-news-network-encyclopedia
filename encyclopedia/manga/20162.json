He's also part of a rock band. The problem is, Eiji has a temper, and a fist. He's very bad with his temper, very good with his fist, and that gets him into trouble. After an incident at a concert one night, he's put on academic probation. His band has had it with him too. His late father was once a champion boxer, and now his older brother is about to get his shot at a title. But the kid has zero interest in boxing until one day the captain of the school boxing team comes by to see his brother.",
