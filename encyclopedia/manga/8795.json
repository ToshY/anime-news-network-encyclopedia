They swim ashore only to find that Japan in 1783 is a land beset by natural disasters, rebellions and brutal reprisals. Their aim is to find a place where they can live as free men in a society of equals but it seems that the Japanese villagers they encounter - oppressed by laws and a rigid social hierarchy and exploited by both feudal lords and criminal gangs - aren't much better off than slaves themselves. Moreover, it is hard for a black man who speaks only English to travel in 18th Century Japan without attracting unwelcome attention. Repeatedly attacked and framed for crimes they didn’t commit, King and George are often forced to rely on their swords and their fists to defend themselves as they wander across Japan in search of freedom.",
