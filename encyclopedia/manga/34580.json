He makes the most of wherever the job sends him, building rapport in each local gay scene and a bon(e)afide booty-call directory. But the hot shot meets his match against the genteel, winsome Albrecht when en route to France. From airplane rowmates, to an invitation to drinks, to the best sex ever in a luxury suite, it's as if fate itself seems to be green-lighting this opportunity. But now Haruto can't seem to escape that heavenly night and resume his carefully crafted no-strings-attached game plan... Especially when Al seems to be plotting to capture Haruto's heart.",
