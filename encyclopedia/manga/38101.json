She finds daily relaxation by watching the streams of Yachiyo Runami, the administrator and super-popular live streamer of the online virtual space \"Tsukuyomi.\" One day, on her way home, Iroha finds a pole shining with rainbow lights. Out of it emerges an adorable baby. She takes the baby home, and it quickly grows into a girl named Kaguya, about Iroha's age. At Kaguya's request, Iroha decides to help with her live-streaming activities on Tsukuyomi. As Iroha creates music as a producer and Kaguya sings as a live streamer, the two gradually grow closer. They have no idea that an ominous shadow is looming that will take Kaguya back to the moon. <em class=de-emphasized>(from movie)</em>",
