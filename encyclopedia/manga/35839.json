Seeking a new beginning, he chooses to move them to a new house with a view of the ocean, hoping for a peaceful setting where they can concentrate on their healing. There, they meet Ryou Kurebayashi, who owns a neighborhood deli, and become regular customers. As Ryou and Yuuichi grow closer, learning about each other's unfortunately similarly tragic pasts, they begin to support one another ― and Ayumu ― day by day, building a little family of their own by the sea.",
