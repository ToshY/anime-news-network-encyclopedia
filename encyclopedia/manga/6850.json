In reality, he was told to keep a low profile until an organization that could handle political power abuse was created. Now he works for the Government Crime Investigation Agency, the Japanese equivalent of the FBI. Along with his Zaiers Gold Black Credit Card, which gives him access to any weapons and location available to him, Jotaro fights against dirty politicians to bring justice back to the Japanese government.",
