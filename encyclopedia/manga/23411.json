But today, all that will change. She is going to confess to him and make the deep contents of her heart known. There's just one small hitch in her plans. Just as she is about to say the words, she loses consciousness. When she awakens, she is in another body, in another time. All she knows is that she shares the same soul with the Lady Sayoko Shinonome, a princess who has been put under a curse that forces her away from her body. It is now up to Akari to uncover the mystery of the spell, stop the demons that are ravaging the land and save the world and save herself so she might get back to her time. That is, if the dark forces that cast the spell don't intervene. Or if the ways and wiles of the heart don't make it so she wants to stay there, in her large house with her new servants, forever.",
