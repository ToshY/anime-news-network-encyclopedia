These days, Tora is a himbo ne'er-do-well and Ryota is slaving over ramen in his hometown. Furthermore Ryota is being set up for marriage by his family. So when Tora hears that his old partner might get taken off the board, he makes a beeline for home hoping to score big with his old teammate. The love between two former ball players can be a little bit of a swing-and-a-miss and a little bit of a homerun.",
