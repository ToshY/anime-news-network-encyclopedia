In every single race, Snev crashes and burns, earning him the disgust of his fellow racers and the adoration of a cult following of fans who love to experience him self-destruct. In his mind, Snev’s races are always accompanied by the phantom figure of the Marathon Man – a crazed runner who managed to get onto the track and was crushed by Snev in his first ever race – and his own inevitable destruction in every race is always as euphoric an experience for him as for the “Crashers” who follow him from the stands. However, following the brutal murder of Snev’s best friend (a prostitute named Beretta) it becomes clear that there is more to Snev’s fatalistic attitude and failure to live up to his early potential than meets the eye and he begins, along with his engineer and a friend of Beretta’s, to untangle a sinister conspiracy.",
