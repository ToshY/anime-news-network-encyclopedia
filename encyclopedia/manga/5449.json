With his knowledge of such things, he helps to solve crimes in 19th century England, which seem to follow him everywhere; thus, the Hargreaves family curse. Eventually, the crimes he solves all seem to point to one organization as their benefactor; Delilah. As Cain runs into Jezebel Disraeli, Delilah's representative, more and more, he comes to learn that the organization was founded by none other than Cain's father, who was, until oh-so-recently, thought to be desceased. Fueled by a reawakened hatred for his father, Cain tries to do everything in his power to help the victims of Delilah's evil-doings.",
