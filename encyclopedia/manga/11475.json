Ten years later, Yousuke tracked down the couple that adopted his sister in... Only to find out that they adopted two daughters (Ayu Anjou and Mayu Anjou) of roughly the same age from the same orphanage and that both girls had an older brother before being adopted. With only vague clues in hand, Yousuke has no idea who his sister is. To make matters worse, Yousuke finds out that the orphanage where he had lived in had burnt down destroying all the adoption records of Ayu and Mayu, and that the couple’s own adoption records are currently missing. It’s now up to Yousuke himself to search for clues to find out whether his sister is Ayu or Mayu.",
