Naturally enthusiastic and helpful, Yuuta often gets involved with the personal lives and problems of Rainbow Forest Cafe's customers. Although a bit impulsive, his involvement usually ends up appreciated; to the extent that most of the (male) customers begin falling for him. Such incidents, added to the overprotectiveness of his best friend Souhei, only make Yuuto's life more complicated. Interesting turns are indeed waiting for this young apprentice as he struggles to pursue his dreams under the guidance of the enigmatic cafe master, Dick Yashima (summary courtesy of Forever-More).",
