Subsequently he finds himself under the watchful eyes of both a Japanese Army research unit and the occupants of the mysterious alien UFOs. The second work is Heart Of Darkness - an adaptation of Joseph Conrad's novel of the same name but relocated to Burma and, again, taking place during WWII. Colonel Kurutsu has taken his troops deep into the jungle and is refusing to obey orders from HQ and Lieutenant Maruo is the cynical, war weary operative sent, along with a patrol boat and its crew, to execute him. The volume concludes with a very short (9 page) dream sequence piece detailing the development of the tank from WWI onwards.",
