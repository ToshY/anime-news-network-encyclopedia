It begins when the protagonist wakes up into a distorted world with a red sky. He soon finds variously mutated beings, vaguely resembling humans, living in a ruined city, and is told by them to visit a place known as the Neuro Tower. He is temporarily joined by a red-eyed human figure known as Archangel, who wears false wings on his back. Archangel informs him that it is the protagonist himself who caused the world to become distorted in an incident known as the \"Blaze\" some time in the past.",
