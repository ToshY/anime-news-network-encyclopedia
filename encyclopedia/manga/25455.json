Unfortunately for him, that girl, named Arisa, is wanted by the military asserting their reign over this world, and they're immediately on Gordon's tail to catch her. Unfortunately for the military, Gordon has his own past that makes him someone they probably shouldn't have messed with. Gordon and Arisa make their way across the landscape, trying to outwit and out-fight their pursuers, and possibly turn a little profit from slinging burgers along the way in their Crazy Food Truck.",
