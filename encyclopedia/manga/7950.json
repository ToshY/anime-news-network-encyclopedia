However, conflict between the two sides remained, resulting in the split between the Red Army, which fought for the Meiji, & the rebellious Black Army, and it all came to a head during the Satsuma Rebellion, with the Black Army being seemingly defeated for good. In reality, though, the Black Army has been recovering in secret, & in the early 1880s one of their Samurai Gun, Gekko, makes his presence known to all when he rescues Kinu, a second-generation Samurai Gun of the Red Army. All the meanwhile there are also experiments being made with a mysterious Russian energy named \"Volgo\", which might have some relation to Gekko himself.",
