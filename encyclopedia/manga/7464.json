On their way there Lynn and her mother get into a tragic car accident in which Lynn’s mother dies. After getting out of the hospital Lynn moves to live in a manor owned by her father who is an English nobleman. The motherless little girl tries to accommodate to high society life and get the approval of her elder step sister, Sara, whose mother has also passed away. At first Sara seems cold and distant towards her new younger sister, because she fears that Lynn’s open and cheerful personality will win over the attention of their father as well as the handsome young man who lives nearby. After various events, the two sisters finally bond, but other hurdles await young Lynn in her quest to become a true lady as her late mother hoped for her to become.",
