The 18-year-old captain of North Kanto Southern High's Cheerleading squad decides to make the most of his summer by attending cram school in Tokyo, only to find out that the whole trip was a sham. Things are looking up when he and his friend meet up with two cute Tokyo girls; too bad the girls brought them to a rip-off bar and took off. Ditched by his one remaining friend and stuck with an impossibly high bar bill, Fuku-kun's life couldn't get any worse. But just then he gets saved by Ume, his role model and former cheerleading squad captain. What is he doing in Tokyo...and why does everyone around seem to know and respect him. Fukuda's summer of cheering others on has begun...and the streets of Tokyo's red-light district will never be the same",
