She was then adopted by her neighbours; the Yasouka's who raised her as their only child. With help from her new father who is a professional shogi player, she learned how to play and master shogi at an early age. Now, at the age of 11, she is taking her first steps at competing in official shogi matches in order to reach the highest ranks in the game. Things don't go smoothly though because she begins to receive mysterious death threats as she advances through her matches in a stark reminder of her parents' murder incident when the only clue at the scene of the crime was a shogi board with all the pieces arranged in perfect order on top.",
