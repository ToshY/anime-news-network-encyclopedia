He didn't want to trust anyone, or give his love to others, so he went to live on his own when he was adopted by another family. One may think that by now he would forget about the murdering incident in his life, but when he encountered someone in the street one dull rainy day....everything changed. The drunk happened to be the famous idol popstar named Koji Nanjo. Ever since their encounter in the street (or rather at Izumi's house), Koji had taken an interest in Izumi...his interest later became deeper than that... A feeling that may be known as \"desperate love\".",
