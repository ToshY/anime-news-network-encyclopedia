When he graduates from high schools his father sends him P-02, an AI, as a congratulation's gift. Not only that but P-02 was told by the professor that Getto was his \"best creation ever\". In hearing that he is determined to find out why and to take that title for himself. When the two meet there's some confusion, but they quickly learn that the most important being in their lives might just be each other.",
