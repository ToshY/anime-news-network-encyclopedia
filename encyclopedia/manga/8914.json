Soon after, Kazuki reveals that he is the school’s Director and Keita’s beloved “Kazu-nii” from his childhood. In this alternate Gakuen Heaven story, Keita is assigned the enormous task of organizing Ginrei Festival, a chance for the students to showcase their talents to the companies that sponsor BL School.
