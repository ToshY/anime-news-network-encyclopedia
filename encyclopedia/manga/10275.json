One day he see a girl in strange clothes. She blows him off and as he's searching for her he sees another girl in strange clothes. He tries to save her from bullies but in the end she curses him. The first girl he met finds him and grants him his wish to go to Artemis. But he's soon told that it takes a lot of power to go between worlds. So that effectively means that now there's no way to return to earth.",
