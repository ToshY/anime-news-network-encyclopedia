This is where the story might have begun and ended... if something strange hadn't happened. Tired of being mocked one day, she suddenly gains a supernatural power during basketball practice. And soon, she is visited by a fox spirit named Ran who informs her that she is infact part fox spirit. At first, she doesn't believe him... until she transforms into a fox herself.",
