He's worried that his friend will be disappointed to see Kaoru is a guy, unlike his female character in the game. But he's the one who's in for a surprise when, instead of another guy, his friend turns out to be a cute girl, Nanami Osaka. On top of that, Nanami told her parents that she would be bringing a friend over—a female friend. Even worse, Nanami's dad is the super overprotective type who won't allow any guys near his daughter. There's only one solution to this dilemma: Kaoru has to cross-dress as a girl.",
