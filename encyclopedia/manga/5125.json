However, one of her classmates tells her that he doesn’t believe in love because he was rejected in his freshman year. She goes to his school to ask him if it’s true, and he doesn’t answer her question, but he offers to take her to the station (since she doesn’t know the way). Minori is still in love with him despite this and decides she’ll make him believe in love again.",
