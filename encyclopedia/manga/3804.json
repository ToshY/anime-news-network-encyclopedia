One morning he recieves a call from his grandmother, Urashima Hina, to go to Hinata Lodge, the same place Keitaro had made the promise with the girl 15 years back. Upon arriving, to his surprise (or shock) Hinata Lodge is no longer an inn, but is now a all-girls dormitory. To make matters worse, he was made the manager of the dormitory against the disapprovals of all the tenants.Volumes 1 to 8 are the 24 episodes of the anime on print, volume 9 is the 25th episode with a brief \"summary\" of the series while 10 and 11 are the X'mas and Spring Specials respectively.",
