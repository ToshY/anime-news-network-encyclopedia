During an interview to settle if he may attend Seinagi Private High School, Taiga is asked what would he want to try if he could use magic. \"Conquer the world\" is his reply and it is followed by a laughter of a cute girl named Aika Hiiragi. Realizing how rude it was of her to laugh at Taiga’s answer she tries to apologize, eventually grasping his hands with tears in her eyes. After that point, he does not remember much else about the interview, but after all he failed to enter the school. Blaming the girl for being rejected, he goes to Seinagi to confront her about it. However, a teacher mistakes Taiga for a student skipping class and pulls him through a strange energy barrier surrounding the school. Not realizing what has just occurred, he has set foot on a school teaching its students how to use magic.",
