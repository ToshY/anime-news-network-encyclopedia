However, due to lack of experience, her performance was not accepted by her colleague Hasumi who, despite of his young age, had been regarded as a genius voice actor. In order to improve her skills, Hasumi half-lured, half-forced Hina to accept a series of \"special trainings,\" especially of those <i>ecchi</i> scenes. Hina, who had a crush on her childhood friend-turned-idol Takeshi, tried to resist Hasumi's \"invitation,\" but she found herself completely defenseless in front of his charming voice.",
