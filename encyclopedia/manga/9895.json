However, when he enters the classroom, nobody can see his beautiful face hidden beneath his thick bangs. At first Yukino is confused as to why he hides his good looks from the class, but as she develops feelings for him, she starts hoping that nobody will see his real face, for fear that the rest of the girls in class will fall in love with him as well.
