She was top of her class and a member of the student council, but she always felt left out when compared to her highly fashionable friends and classmates. All that changed when her classmate Matsuki Asahi blackmailed her into applying for a modeling position with the popular magazine \"Lollypop\". After attempted sabotage by fellow applicants, Nina secured a position, and went on to make appearances on morning television, TV commercials, and even a soap opera, all while struggling with her developing feelings for Asahi.",
