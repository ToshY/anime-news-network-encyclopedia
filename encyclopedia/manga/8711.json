He was in an orphanage for the next few years and it was there that he decided the purpose of his life would be to help others. He's now living in a dorm at his school and is heavily involved in campus life and happy. That is, until some bizarre street vendors show up claiming that he is their lost brother. They also tell him that he was not born on this world. There is a dimensional door that can be opened to Yamato, a realm of magical beings and otherworldly creatures. The brothers decide to take Riku there to jog his memory and to help run the general store their family has managed for three generations.",
