She asks him to match her up with somebody, and, though seemingly impossible, takes on the job. The closer he gets to her, he sees that someone is targeting her. First it seems to be a boy who she rejected but we find out that it's Yamagishi-sensei who's targeting her. Yamagishi-sensei targets Hatsune because she apparently saw Yamagishi-sensei while she was doing her drug transactions, taking the disguise as a librarian and doing her drug deals there. Yamagishi-sensei's caught, and it's found out that Hatsune does have a fragrance - it just mixed so well with Kabuki's that he couldn't sniff it out, meaning that they were meant to be together.",
