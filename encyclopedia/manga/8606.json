Left to fend for himself, Atsushi fails to learn human speech and instead learns \"cat language\" and \"Dog language\" from the family pets.

After developing a rather sizeable fixation with Satou Manato, he finds out that there his first friend is seriously ill and has a twin; Shuuto. Years later, two other friends begin school and find that there are two Satous in their class too. Two Satous who, at first glance, could easily be mistaken for twins, but there's a bit more to things than it first appears...",
