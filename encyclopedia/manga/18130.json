Upon retirement he started up a small yakiniku joint, serving up grilled meats and his house specialty: hormone (grilled organ meats full of nutrient rich biochemicals). Running a restaurant proves harder than Genryu thought, and he soon finds himself taking out usurious loans from a sadistic loan shark by the name of Momota. The contract they forge to keep his business afloat, soon proves to be the beginning of his downfall.<br>Includes short stories \"The Contracts of the Fall,\" \"Lover Boy,\" \"Pochi\" and \"Der fliegende Hollaender\" (aka \"The Flying Dutchman\").",
