Instead of himself working his way up to the NBA, he feels that Kyo, his daughter should fulfill his dream. To give Kyo a good start in her career of basketball he enrolls her in Seishu High School. The school is known for two things: its extremely cute girls' uniforms and their boys' basketball team; fourth best in the country. Not only does unhappy Kyo have to pretend to be a boy during the day (the basketball team members all live at the school to boost the team spirit), she has to do it day and night. The super-star of the team, Chiharu Eniwa, may be a good-looking, basketball champion, but his attitude towards Kyo is hostile from their very first meeting. Poor Kyo ends up roommates with the evil Chiharu. They are forced to be nice to each other and as they get to know one another, both sense that the other has a secret.",
