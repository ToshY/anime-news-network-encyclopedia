Volume 1 (Reflections): in \"The Mirror\" a beautiful girl finds herself being usurped by her own vindictive reflection after it frees itself from her mirror and in \"Demon Of Vengeance\" a samurai's son's fate is tied to that of his lord's son as part of a cruel and unjust punishment for failing in his duty. Volume 2 (Insects): In the sole, self-titled tale a young woman with a phobia of butterflies is terrorised by a black butterfly that seems to be a harbinger of doom and which seems to relate somehow to her late mother and her new step-mother. Volume 3 (Faces): In \"Fear\" sibling rivalry between a plain girl and her beautiful older sister rises to murderous levels after the older girl is disfigured in a fall and in \"The Coincidental Letter\" events snowball out of control when a schoolgirl decides to vent her frustration by sending an abusive letter to a random address.",
