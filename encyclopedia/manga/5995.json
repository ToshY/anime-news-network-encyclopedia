The first two stories are faux autobiographical – in the first (A Lullaby From Hell), Hino describes his disturbing upbringing and his discovery that he has the ability to kill anyone in a manner of his choosing merely by thinking about it and in the second (Unusual Fetus – My Baby) Hino’s wife gives birth to a bloodthirsty reptilian baby. In the third story (Train Of Terror), a boy named Shuichi and two of his friends are travelling by train when they encounter a ghostly stranger with a sinister influence – worse still, when they return to Tokyo the stranger’s there too and he’s been visiting their parents… The final story (Zoroku’s Strange Disease) tells the tale of a retarded villager who loves to draw nature scenes. After he develops a strange disease and is ostracised by the other villagers, he finds that his own body can provide all of the vibrant natural colours that his paints could never live up to.",
