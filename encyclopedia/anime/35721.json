He lives there with several children of various ages, including harmonica-blowing oddball Junsuke and his toddler brother Shousuke, studious, homesick new boy Sei, considerate orphan Megumu, and teenager siblings Kenji and Asako. They are taken care of by Mr Adachi and Miss Mitsuko in a small town in Mie Prefecture, their house filled with the sounds of 70s Japanese pop and enka hits and TV puroresu and sumo matches. The kids step outside their daily lives via the Sunny, a junked Datsun in the yard which acts variously as imaginary spaceship, confessional, and soft porn library. In this slice of life manga, each subtly realised chapter explores the characters, what brought them to the home, their tests of the boundaries of their lives, and the hopes and dreams that they may or may not have hope of realising. <em class=de-emphasized>(from manga)</em>",
